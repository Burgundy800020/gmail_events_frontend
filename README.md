# Gmail Events (Frontend)

A modern, intuitive web interface for visualizing and managing events automatically extracted from your Gmail inbox. This project is the **frontend companion** to the [Gmail Events (backend)](https://github.com/Burgundy800020/gmail_events), which uses LLM's to scan your emails, extract event details, and make them available via a robust API.

## What is Gmail Events?

**Gmail Events** is an intelligent automation tool that leverages LLM's to scan your Gmail inbox, extract structured event information (title, date, time, location, items to bring), and seamlessly present it in a user-friendly calendar view. Never miss an important meeting, appointment, or social event buried in your inbox again!

This repository provides the **React-based frontend** for the system, allowing you to:
- Instantly view your upcoming events in a weekly calendar.
- See all extracted details (name, time, location, items to bring) at a glance.
- Enjoy a clean, responsive, and modern UI.
